>An Observer is an object that wishes to be notified when a change occurs in the system. The entity generating the change(event) is called observable or subject.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

- <b>We need to be informed when certain things happen</b>

  - Object's property changes
  
  - Object does something
  
  - Some external event occurs
  
- <b>We want to listen to events and be notified when they occur</b>
  - Notifications should include useful data
  
- <b>Unsubscribe from events when we are no longer interested</b>
