><h1>Singleton</h1>

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

>Critics consider the singleton to be an anti-pattern in that it is frequently used in scenarios where it's not beneficial, introduces unnecessary restrictions in situations where a sole instance of a class is not actually required, and introduces global state into an application..

<h5>Long story short. A singleton is a component(class) that is instantiated only once.</h5>
