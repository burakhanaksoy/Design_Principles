<h3>Strategy</h3>

>"Enables the exact behavior of system to be selected at run-time.The strategy pattern allows grouping related algorithms under an abstraction, which allows switching out one algorithm or policy for another without modifying the client. Instead of directly implementing a single algorithm, the code receives runtime instructions specifying which of the group of algorithms to run."
